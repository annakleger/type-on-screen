                <p class="text">Let's start at the end -
                    You're telling me you'll always be my friend -
                    You're leaving for good -
                    Made a mess and stayed longer than you ever should -
                    You ask me what's wrong -
                    Been playing this game we started far too long -
                    I wish you all the best -
                    Never wanna hear your voice or see you again -
                    Now we're happily never after -
                    Now we're happily never after -
                    And I don't know what you were after -
                    Now we're happy -
                    Long walks in the park -
                    All the secrets we whispered after dark -
                    Yellow flowers you gave -
                    Songs you wrote me, but you never got to sing -
                    All the love we never made -
                    We were growing to close, so you ran away -
                    I'm not the one who broke your heart -
                    Never should've fell in love, I knew it from the start -
                    Now we're happily never after -
                    Now we're happily never after -
                    And I don't know what you were after -
                    Now we're happy -
                    Now we're happy -
                    Never wanna hear your voice or see you again -
                    Now we're happily never after -
                    Now we're happily never after -
                    And I don't know what you were after -
                    Now we're happily never after -
                    Now we're happily never after -
                    And I don't know what you were after -
                    Now we're happily never after -
                    Now we're happy</p>

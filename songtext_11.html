                <p class="text"> never thought I'd have to write this song -
                    Just yesterday I woke up and heard the news -
                    I still can't believe you're gone -
                    It doesn't make any sense to any of us -
                    I didn't even get to say goodbye -
                    I did my best for you -
                    My very best for you -
                    There was that time in September -
                    I lost my temper and thought I would leave -
                    I remember I was a real bitch that day and I regret it -
                    I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, babe -
                    I did my best for you -
                    My very best for you -
                    Oh God, look down -
                    Oh God, look down upon me now -
                    Oh, oh God -
                    Oh God look down upon me now -
                    I don't forgive myself for all the things I never did -
                    Can you forgive me for all the things -
                    I didn't know just how to do? -
                    I did my best for you -
                    My very best for you -
                    For me and you -
                    For me and you -
                    For me and you -
                    For me and you</p>

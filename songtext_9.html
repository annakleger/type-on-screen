                    Sola solita no acompaña -
                    Dios te bendiga y favorezca -
                    Tu eres la unica mama -
                    Mira la negrita -
                    Como baila el bembe -
                    La mandan las brujitas -
                    De Guayama y Cayey -
                    Es la mas mala -
                    Que nació en el batey -
                    Y manda en la ley -
                    Don't you put me in red -
                    I hate it -
                    Don't you put me in red -
                    You don't know how much I hate it -
                    Ask me where I'm going -
                    Don't ask me where I'm from -
                    I speak in three languages -
                    You barely speak in one -
                    Kids you put in cages -
                    Look like they could be my sons -
                    You forget we were here -
                    When the west was won -
                    Been gone for a while -
                    So you thought I was done -
                    Been through hell and back -
                    And I've only just begun -
                    Dress me -
                    Undress me -
                    I'm so spicy -
                    You don't like me -
                    Don't you put me in red -
                    I hate it -
                    Don't you put me in red -
                    You don't know how much I hate it -
                    Don't you put me in red -
                    Oh, that's the color -
                    You think I've been looking for -
                    You put me in red -
                    Oh, that's the color -
                    You think I'll spend my life with -
                    Oh, oh -
                    Don't, don't, don't, don't -
                    Don't, don't, don't -
                    Don't, no, don't, don't, don't  -

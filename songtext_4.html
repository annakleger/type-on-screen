                    I caught a fever 'cause I rhyme my rhymes right -
                    And my doobie wrap's tight -
                    And my starlight shines bright, bright -
                    I'm just a lover I don't want to fight -
                    But you keep putting me in cages -
                    Every day and night -
                    It keeps repeating upon me -
                    Woo, the same old story keeps -

                    Or I'll be a danger -
                    The truth is I'm a threat -
                    And it's got you upset-t-t-t -
